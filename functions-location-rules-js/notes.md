# Notes

## Template Not Available in CLI

As of October 5, 2025, the `fulfillment_groups_location_rankings` function template is not yet available in the Shopify CLI for generation. The template files exist but cannot be generated using `shopify app generate extension`.

This means the integration tests in the `tests/` directory cannot be verified locally until the template is added to the supported extension types in the CLI.

# Conditional admin action extension group

## Action extension

Admin action extensions enable app developers to build custom functionality into the context of Shopify Admin. These extensions surface as launchable menu actions that open interactive modals at various extension targets and enhance the merchant experience. Developers can build the content of these extensions using Shopify's UI Extension components for Admin.

## Admin data extensions to conditionally control action extension triggers

Admin data extensions run in the browser like UI extensions but do not return any UI. Instead, an admin data extension returns specific data, as permitted by the contract with the extension point that it runs in. Admin action condition extensions are a specific type of admin data extension used to control the visibility of an admin action trigger in the "More actions" menu on a given resource page. They are expected to return a data object that determines the visibility of a related admin action extension.

## Get started with this extension

This extension provides search functionality for the Shopify Admin. After installation, your app's search results will appear in Admin search.

### Key files

- `src/ToolsData.{{ srcFileExtension }}` - Main extension code that registers the search tool
- `src/tools.json` - Schema definition for the search tool inputs and outputs

### How it works

1. The extension registers a `search` tool using `shopify.tools.register()`
2. When a user searches in the Admin, your search function is called with the query
3. Your function returns results matching the schema defined in `tools.json`

### Customizing the search

Edit `src/ToolsData.{{ srcFileExtension }}` to implement your search logic:

1. Fetch data from your app's backend or API
2. Filter/search the data based on the `query` input
3. Return results in the expected format with pagination info

### Testing locally

Run `shopify app dev` to test your extension in development mode.

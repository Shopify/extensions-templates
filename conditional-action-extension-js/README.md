# Conditional admin action extension group

## Action extension

Admin action extensions enable app developers to build custom functionality into the context of Shopify Admin. These extensions surface as launchable menu actions that open interactive modals at various extension targets and enhance the merchant experience. Developers can build the content of these extensions using Shopify's UI Extension components for Admin.

Learn more about Admin action extensions in Shopify’s [developer documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/admin/admin-actions-and-blocks).

## Conditionally rendered admin action extension triggers

Merchants launch admin action extensions by clicking on menu items in the "More actions" menu on a resource page. Developers can control the visibility of these triggers with the `should_render` property in the extension's TOML file. The `should_render` module manages the visibility of admin action triggers by returning a data object that specifies if the related admin action extension should be displayed.

## Preparing your SVG icon for specifications
  App icon guidelines https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/design/visual-design#app-icon

  The viewbox of the svg icon MUST be 20 x 20 with origin in 0.

  Recommended: 

    Design your app icon at 1200px x 1200px. 

    Your icon should not include rounded corners.

    Your icon should at most fill 10/16ths (750px for a 1200px icon) of a vertical or horizontal space.

    Your icon should at most fill 12/16ths (900px for a 1200px icon) of a vertical or horizontal space.

    Leave a 1/16th (75px for a 1200px icon) margin around your icon that's free of any visual elements.

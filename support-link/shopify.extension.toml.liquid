# For embedded apps URIs are defined relative to the domain of the configured application_url in your shopify.app.toml
# If you enter an empty path the link will resolve to the configured application_url in your shopify.app.toml
# For example, app:// or / will resolve to the application_url https://my-app-domain.com/home
# All other paths will be resolved relative to the domain of the application_url
# For example, app://path or /path with configured application_url https://my-app-domain.com/home will resolve to https://my-app-domain.com/path
